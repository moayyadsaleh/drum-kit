# drum-kit
This repository demonstrates the implementation of a virtual drum kit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive drumming experience on a web page.
Technical Highlights:

CSS Styling: The drum buttons are styled using CSS, allowing for customization of their appearance, including size, color, and position. CSS classes are used to define the styling rules and create visual effects for button animations.

DOM Interaction: The Document Object Model (DOM) is utilized to interact with HTML elements dynamically. Event listeners are added to the drum buttons and the document itself, responding to user clicks and key presses. This enables the triggering of drum sounds and button animations upon interaction.
